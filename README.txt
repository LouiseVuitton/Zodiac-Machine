This is a project by Chanel Brown for Code Louisville Fall 2017. 

This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a website that will calculate the user's zodiac sign. The user will enter their month and day, then click a button. The page will display the user's zodiac sign, along with a brief horoscope. I am looking for a daily horoscope API so the horoscope will change.

This information can be copied and pasted into the text editor of your choice. I tweaked the JavaScript from http://www.javascriptsource.com/math-related/astrological-calculator.html. I liked this code a lot, but I wanted to simplify for a first project with JavaScript.
