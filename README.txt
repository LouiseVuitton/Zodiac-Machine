This is a project by Chanel Brown for Code Louisville Fall 2017. 

This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a website that will calculate the user's zodiac sign. The user will receive two JavaScript alerts: one displaying the birthday and the other revealing their zodiac sign.

In the future, I want to integrate an API in order to display the user's daily horoscope on the page, along with a lightbox highlighting the user's zodiac sign.
