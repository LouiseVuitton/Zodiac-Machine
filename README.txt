This is a project by Chanel Brown for Code Louisville Fall 2017. 

This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a website that will calculate the user's zodiac sign. The user will receive two JavaScript alerts: one displaying the birthday and the other revealing their zodiac sign.

In the future, I want to integrate an API in order to display the user's daily horoscope on the page, along with a lightbox highlighting the user's zodiac sign. 

This information can be copied and pasted into the text editor of your choice. I tweaked the JavaScript from http://www.javascriptsource.com/math-related/astrological-calculator.html. I liked this code a lot, but I wanted to simplify for a first project with JavaScript.
